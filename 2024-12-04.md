# Ownership & Smart Pointers

<!-- _class: lead -->

Early-Adopter Session 27.11.2024

## Topics

- Ownership in C++
- Smart pointers
- Ownership in Ginkgo

## Ownership Definition

Resources are owned by some entity which:
- manages acquiring the resource (memory allocation, opening file, locking mutex),
- manages releasing the resource (freeing memory, closing file, unlocking mutex),
- manages copying/moving the resource (or disables them).

These actions that have to be done explicitly in C++.

## Ownership Example
```cpp
{
  std::vector<int> data1(n, -1);  // allocates memory for n ints
  // data1 owns the allocated memory in this block
  ...
} // data1 releases its memory
{
  int* data2 = new int[n];  // allocates memory for n ints
  // data 2 owns the allocated memory in this block
  ...
} // data2 does not release its memory
// memory from data2 not owned by anyone
// this causes a memory leak
```

## Ownership of Dynamic Allocations


Allocating memory of variable size, or polymorphic objects should use heap allocations: `A* obj_ptr = new A(args...);`.

The pointer is owner of the memory resource, but it's not automatically released.

Has to be released manually with: `delete obj_ptr;` (or `delete[] obj_ptr;`).

```cpp
{
  int* data2 = new int[n];
  ...
  delete[] data2;  // data2 releases its memory
} // no memory leak
```

## Reminder Polymorphism

```c++
struct Base {
  virtual void func() = 0;
};
struct Derived: Base {
  void func() override {}
}

Base* derived = new Derived();
derived->func();

// void apply(Base base);  // might not work as expected due to slicing
void apply(Base* base);
apply(derived);
```

Polymorphic objects should be **stored as pointers** (or references).

## Automatic Management of Dynamic Allocations

STL provides 'pointers' which automatically handle resource acquisition and release:
- `std::unique_ptr<T>`
- `std::shared_ptr<T>`

Both ensure that resource is allocated and freed when appropriate.

Helper functions for allocation are available:
-  `std::make_unique<T>(constructor args)` 
-  `std::make_shared<T>(constructor args)`

## Smart Pointers are Pointers

Both smart pointers provide normal pointer syntax:
- `smart_ptr->func()`
- `T& ref = *smart_ptr`

Direct access to the underlying 'raw' pointer is available:
- `T* ptr = smart_ptr.get()`

Sensible casting of pointers to polymorphic objects:
```c++
std::unique_ptr<Base> = std::move(std::unique_ptr<Derived>);
std::shared_ptr<Base> = std::shared_ptr<Derived>;
std::shared_ptr<Derived> = std::dynamic_pointer_cast(std::shared_ptr<Base>); 
// not available for std::unique_ptr
```

## Unique Resource Ownership

A `std::unique_ptr<T>` has unique ownership of the resource of type `T`.

Only the unique pointer is responsible to release the resource.
This is done automatically when pointer is destroyed.

Ownership can be transferred only through move semantics:
```c++
std::unique_ptr<T> a = std::make_unique<T>();
std::unique_ptr<T> b = a; // doesn't compile
std::unique_ptr<T> c = std::move(a)  // works, now c owns the T object
```

Should be considered the default almost always.

## Shared Resource Ownership

A `std::shared_ptr<T>` shares ownership of the resource of type `T` with other `std::shared_ptr`.

The owner count automatically tracked, which introduces a slight extra cost compared to handling `T*`.

Only the last owner of a shared resource will release it:
```c++
std::shared_ptr<T> a = std::make_shared<T>();  //owners: a
{
  std::shared_ptr<T> b = a; //owners: a, b
  {
    std::shared_ptr<T> c = b; //owners: a, b, c
    ...
  }  // owners: a, b, resource not freed
} // owners: a, resource not freed
```

## Observing Resources

Ownership is not always necessary:
```c++
struct Base {
  virtual void do_computation() = 0;
};

void use(Base* obj){  
  ...
  // only using obj to call a function, so passing std::unique_ptr<Base>
  // or std::shared_ptr<Base> is unnecessary
  obj->do_computation();
  ...
}
```

## Ownership in Ginkgo

All Ginkgo objects for polymorphic types need to be stored as pointers.
This includes all objects under the `gko::LinOp` and `gko::Executor` hierarchy.

Ginkgo follows the rule: *A type with CamelCase uses polymorphism.*

For these types, creating non-pointer objects is **not available**, instead helper functions to create a Ginkgo object, managed by a smart pointer, are provided:

```c++
gko::matrix::Csr<> mtx(exec); // doesn't compile
auto mtx = gko::matrix::Csr<>::create(exec); // works
```

This ensures that Ginkgo objects automatically manage their resources.

## Unique vs Shared in Ginkgo

These objects are created as **shared pointers**:
- `gko::Executor`
- `gko::log::ProfilerHook`, `gko::log::SolverProgress`

All other objects are created as **unique pointers**:
```c++
std::unique_ptr<gko::matrix::Csr<>> mtx = gko::matrix::Csr<>::create(exec);
```

It is always possible to create a `std::shared_ptr` from a `std::unique_ptr` (but never vice versa):
```c++
auto mtx = gko::matrix::Csr<>::create(exec);
std::shared_ptr<...> shared_mtx = std::move(mtx);
auto shared_mtx = gko::share(std::move(mtx));
```

## Using Smart Pointers in Ginkgo


It is almost always unnecessary to think about which type of smart pointer is used. Ginkgo is designed such that the pieces automatically fit together.

Examples:
- Objects of `gko::Executor` type are always created as `std::shared_ptr` and they are always expected to be `std::shared_ptr`
- Applying `gko::LinOp` always works regardless of smart pointer type


Take caution when:

- Adding a logger. The logger object needs to be a `std::shared_ptr`.
- Using a factory. The factory input has to be a `std::shared_ptr`.


## Array View and Ownership

By default, the `gko::array` owns the memory it handles.

But it can be created with no ownership:
```c++
gko::array arr = gko::make_array_view(exec, size, data_ptr);
```

When `arr` is deleted, the `data_ptr` is left unchanged.
